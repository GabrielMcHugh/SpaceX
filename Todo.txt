App Goal:
Make a mini app to test setting up one set of endpoints to modify a single list
1. Load list of launchpads and save them on a mongodb
2. Allow the user to add a new launchpad entry
2. Allow the user to delete a launchpad entry
3. Allow the user to update a launchpad data

Todo:
[] Update rendered list with new entry on adding new entry
[] Add error handling for loadLaunchpad()
[x] Add error handling for when can't connect to mongoDB
[x] Add an input which adds a new entry
[x] Call launchpads list from mongodb and load on handlebars list
[x] Connect to mongodb server

- I've added the code for saving a launchpad but I need to rerender the list with the
new launchpad
- Need error handling for when mongoose can't connect in the connectMongoose and 
loadLaunchpad functions()
- Added error handling for connectMongoose. Now just need it for loadLaunchpad()

(21/7/23)
- At home so I can connect to the mongodb server. Just gonna finish up this project here
- launchpads are saving on mongodb. Now I want to load them on the page.
- Have to call them and render them using handlebars

(20/7/23)
- I need to make the mongodb server locally so I can access into
- Also maybe I should make it a postgreSQL server. Would be a more valuable databsae to know
- I also would like to create a App Diagram and a Database Diagram. I've decided I will change it to PostgresSQL instead
- I've decided against this. PostgresSQL and learning about it seems like a seperate project. 
Right now I'll keep it simple
- Setting up mongodb locally following this guide https://zellwk.com/blog/local-mongodb/

(19/7/23)
- Setting up httpGetAllLaunchpads endpoint
- Need to setup loadLaunchpads to load Data into Mongo db
