App Goal:
Make a mini app to test setting up one set of endpoints to modify a single list
1. Load list of launchpads and save them on a mongodb
2. Allow the user to add a new launchpad entry
2. Allow the user to delete a launchpad entry
3. Allow the user to update a launchpad data

Todo:
[] Setup postgres server

(20/7/23)
- I need to make the mongodb server locally so I can access into
- Also maybe I should make it a postgreSQL server. Would be a more valuable databsae to know
- I also would like to create a App Diagram and a Database Diagram. I've decided I will change it to PostgresSQL instead
- I've decided against this. PostgresSQL and learning about it seems like a seperate project. 
Right now I'll keep it simple
- Setting up mongodb locally following this guide https://zellwk.com/blog/local-mongodb/

(19/7/23)
- Setting up httpGetAllLaunchpads endpoint
- Need to setup loadLaunchpads to load Data into Mongo db
