App Goal:
Make a mini app to test setting up one set of endpoints to modify a single list
1. Load list of launchpads and save them on a mongodb
2. Allow the user to add a new launchpad entry
2. Allow the user to delete a launchpad entry
3. Allow the user to update a launchpad data

Todo next project:
1. Use Typescript
2. Setup testing at the start
3. Add authentication
4. Have a front end with angular
5. Have a distribution folder


Todo:
[] Fill out the other endpoints
[] Create a distribution folder and serve from it
[x] Update rendered list with new entry on adding new entry on success response
[x] Create more inputs for the form so that it posts data with the required fields
[x] Add error handling for loadLaunchpad()
[x] Add error handling for when can't connect to mongoDB
[x] Add an input which adds a new entry
[x] Call launchpads list from mongodb and load on handlebars list
[x] Connect to mongodb server

- Refactored spaceX script: Added name input and now that launchpad name will be 
added to list ifa success response is returned
- Refactored missing fields list into "enum". Theres no TS so will need to try do express
with TS next time
- What I want from a distribution file is for the files to be minified and 
uglified before being sent

- httpAddNewLaunchpads now prints out missing fields in POST request 
and saveLaunchpad now has an error handler
- Added rest of the inputs for launchpad properties and now it properly POSTs
- Need to update the front end with additional entry on rendered list when a
success response is returned

(25/7/23)
- Added httpAddNewLaunchPads http request to front end along with form and button
- Now just need to add more form inputs for entry values then use JS to format
them into the right type

(24/7/23)
- I've added the code for saving a launchpad but I need to rerender the list with the
new launchpad
- Need error handling for when mongoose can't connect in the connectMongoose and 
loadLaunchpad functions()
- Added error handling for connectMongoose. Now just need it for loadLaunchpad()

(21/7/23)
- At home so I can connect to the mongodb server. Just gonna finish up this project here
- launchpads are saving on mongodb. Now I want to load them on the page.
- Have to call them and render them using handlebars

(20/7/23)
- I need to make the mongodb server locally so I can access into
- Also maybe I should make it a postgreSQL server. Would be a more valuable databsae to know
- I also would like to create a App Diagram and a Database Diagram. I've decided I will change it to PostgresSQL instead
- I've decided against this. PostgresSQL and learning about it seems like a seperate project. 
Right now I'll keep it simple
- Setting up mongodb locally following this guide https://zellwk.com/blog/local-mongodb/

(19/7/23)
- Setting up httpGetAllLaunchpads endpoint
- Need to setup loadLaunchpads to load Data into Mongo db
